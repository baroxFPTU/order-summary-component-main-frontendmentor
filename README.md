### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

I intend to follow the front end developer road map. Now I am learning Javascript and NodeJS, and I want to make sure the knowledge before I change to learn React. Besides that, I am developing my project with goals to hand on what I've know. If you are interested, you can contact me through Facebook or my email below. Thank you.
